-=MUSIC TODO=-
 * MUSIC TYPES: Music is split up into several files per track for different conditions
   * DRUMS: Critical Condition
     * If the drums go away you need to retreat to safety, STAT.
     * They indicate that your character is healthy and still has plenty of ammo to spare.
     * If you have more than one-fifth health and one-fifth mags/reloads, these play.
   * TINGS: Combat Condition
     * If the KSSynth tings start playing, you know shit's about to hit the fan.
     * They indicate that combat has started; e.g, there's >=10 zombies nearby.
     * They don't stop until combat is close to finished; e.g, there's <=5 zombies nearby.
   * PINGS: Weapons Condition
     * If the SubSynth pings are on, you're probably just mining, or fighting off zambies.
     * They play whenever your weapon is out; meaning that you hear them when mining, too.
     * They stop whenever you holster your weapon.
   * ORGAN: Civilization Condition
     * If the organ is on, you're probably either mining a large vein of ore, or at home.
     * Plays whenever there's a lot of non-zambie damage-taking objects near, like buildings.
     * Specifically, when there's >=25 Damagable-tagged non-Zambie objects nearby.
 * TRACKS: There are a few different looping tracks made up of the above types.
   * OST Tracks 4-6: The Dude's theme(s)
     * The first track made post-LD.  This is always tense, sometimes determination-inducing, and sometimes determination-crushing.
     * The default track that comes on when you're playing The Dude, although others are available.
