	 * SPECIAL: ???
   * PLAYSTYLE: Noob-friendly in every way
     * The Dude is an uncomplicated character.  His buildings are simple and effective for turtling, and his weapon's good.
     * His pistol is powerful, high-capacity, and has a variable semi-auto RoF; it's as fast as you need it to be.
     * While he lacks some of the tactical depth that other characters can rock, he's simple and powerful.

     * Landmine: Explodes (permanently) when stuff walks on top, including the player.  Available to Offensive characters.  5 ore.
	 * SPECIAL: ???
   * PLAYSTYLE: Shooter-game incarnate
	 * The Psycho is a murder-machine; loads of health, ammo, and damage per shot, with offensive drone allies that can help him.
	 * His shotgun is an offensive weapon of IMPRESSIVE damage potential, but it's hampered by slow reloads and lower RoF.
	 * While he lacks some of the base-buildy goodness that Defensive characters have got, he's loads of fun for just rampaging.
 * THE WARRIOR
   * HP: 20
   * ORE: 150
   * AMMO: 5 r/M revolver with 20 speedloaders, doing high-accuracy damage with constant semi-auto RoF and mid-speed reloads

	 * Landmine: Explodes (permanently) when stuff walks on top, including the player.  Available to Offensive characters.  5 ore.
   * PLAYSTYLE: Basebuilding to the max
	 * The Warrior is a base-building monster, having access to more offensive DPS-focused buildings and defensive constructions alike.
	 * Her revolver is high-power, able to oneshot the generic zombies even in Drool difficulty, even from afar.
	 * However, she doesn't get any special buildings of her own, and she has to reload frequently in combat.
 * THE RATTMANN
   * HP: 25
   * ORE: 75
   * AMMO: TBD r/M smg with TBD magazines, doing low-accuracy spray-n-pray pew pews with constant full-auto RoF and mid-speed reloads

	 * Caltrops: Slowly damages anything walking over them, including the player.  Available to Offensive characters.  5 ore.
	 * SPECIAL: ???
   * PLAYSTYLE: Kiting chaos funtimes
	 * The Rattmann is chaos incarnate, as playable characters go, with turrets and caltrops making deadly defenses, and SMG spray 24/7.
	 * Their SMG is highish power; each bullet only does one damage, but when you're spraying hundreds out per minute...it adds up.
	 * However, the downside of this is that it takes longer to kill enemies, and the inaccuracy means long-range frags are hard.
-=MUSIC TODO=-
 * MUSIC TYPES: Music is split up into several files per track for different conditions
   * DRUMS: Critical Condition
     * If the drums go away you need to retreat to safety, STAT.
     * They indicate that your character is healthy and still has plenty of ammo to spare.
     * If you have more than one-fifth health and one-fifth mags/reloads, these play.
   * TINGS: Combat Condition
     * If the KSSynth tings start playing, you know shit's about to hit the fan.
     * They indicate that combat has started; e.g, there's >=10 zombies nearby.
     * They don't stop until combat is close to finished; e.g, there's <=5 zombies nearby.
   * PINGS: Weapons Condition
     * If the SubSynth pings are on, you're probably just mining, or fighting off zambies.
     * They play whenever your weapon is out; meaning that you hear them when mining, too.
     * They stop whenever you holster your weapon.
   * ORGAN: Civilization Condition
     * If the organ is on, you're probably either mining a large vein of ore, or at home.
     * Plays whenever there's a lot of non-zambie damage-taking objects near, like buildings.
     * Specifically, when there's >=25 Damagable-tagged non-Zambie objects nearby.
 * TRACKS: There are a few different looping tracks made up of the above types.
   * OST Tracks 4-6: The Dude's theme(s)
     * The first track made post-LD.  This is always tense, sometimes determination-inducing, and sometimes determination-crushing.
     * The default track that comes on when you're playing The Dude, although others are available.
