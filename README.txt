-=DESCRIPTION=-
You've crash-landed on a planet.  Your ship was almost completely destroyed on impact.  But your escape pod survived, and you were able to grab some emergency supplies.  You can get out of here, but it'll take time.

-=MINIMUM VIABLE PRODUCT=-
 * Functional top-down 2d controls that have the same sort of punchy feel that Nuclear Throne and co rock
 * Main menu w/ a "new game", "help", and "quit" button
 * Basic power system ASAHP
 * Enemies and shooting ASAHP; attempt to minimize the bullet-helliness, and maximize the inherent enjoyment of shooting
 * Win and lose conditions (Win by fully charging the main battery, lose by dying or having the sterilizer battery die)

-=GAMEPLAY=-
 * A top-down 2d shooter in the vein of Nuclear throne in terms of controls.
   * Graphically, reminiscent of The Final Station
   * Punchy Nuclear Throne style shooting
   * Minimal bullet hell because fuck bullet hells
 * Running out of power...
   * Your generator uses a fuel source of which there are limited quantities
   * If it runs out, you still have some breathing room; your ship isn't immediately compromised
   * You can upgrade it, but you have to be careful not to break it trying to upgrade too quickly
 * Base-building and resource management...
   * You can use your energy and resources to make other things that might help you survive longer
   * For example, turrets require ammo and energy, but they can keep your base safe in your absence
   * Upgrading your power system with more efficient generators and auxiluary batteries isn't a bad idea
 * Can you survive long enough?
   * The world is harsh, and there's more than one way to lose
   * Your escape pod needs to recharge to let you leave, and that requires power
   * It needs to be kept sterilized, as well, and that also requires power
 * It's not all doom and gloom, though.
   * You still have a good gun, and some of the other munitions from the ship may have landed nearby
   * Ammo is semi-unlimited; you still need to reload, and your reserve is limited, but you can manufacture more with power
   * The bullet hell trope's inverted, too; your guns are more bullet hell for enemies than they are for you
